          <h3>The Rabbit</h3>
          <p>
            The domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus) is the domesticated form of the European rabbit.
            There
            are hundreds of rabbit breeds originating from all over the world. Rabbits were first domesticated and
            used
            for food and fur by the Romans. Rabbits may be housed inside, but the idea of the domestic rabbit as a
            house
            companion, a so-called house rabbit (similar to a house cat), was only strongly promoted starting with
            publications in the 1980s. Rabbits can be trained to use a litter box and taught to come when called, but
            require exercise and can damage a house or injure themselves if it has not been suitably prepared, based
            on
            their innate need to chew. Accidental interactions between pet rabbits and wild rabbits, while seemingly
            harmless, are strongly discouraged due to the species' different temperaments as well as wild rabbits
            potentially carrying diseases.
            <br><br>
            Unwanted pet rabbits sometimes end up in animal shelters, especially after the Easter season. In 2017,
            they
            were the United States' third most abandoned pet. Some of them go on to be adopted and become family pets
            in
            various forms. Because their wild counterparts have become invasive in Australia, pet rabbits are banned
            in
            the state of Queensland. Domestic rabbits — bred for generations under human supervision to be docile —
            lack
            survival instincts, and perish in the wild if they are abandoned or escape from captivity.
            <br><br>
            Domestic rabbits are raised as livestock for their meat, wool (in the case of the Angora breeds) and/or
            fur.
            They are also kept as pets and used as laboratory animals. Specific breeds are used in different
            industries;
            Rex rabbits, for example, are commonly raised for their fur, Californians are commonly raised for meat and
            New
            Zealands are commonly used in animal testing for their nearly identical appearance. Aside from the
            commercial
            or pet application, rabbits are commonly raised for exhibition at shows.

          <h3>The Guinea pig</h3>
          <p>
            The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as the cavy or domestic cavy (/ˈkeɪvi/
            KAY-vee), is a species of rodent belonging to the genus Cavia, family Caviidae. Breeders tend to use the
            name "cavy" for the animal, but "guinea pig" is more commonly used in scientific and laboratory contexts.[1]
            Despite their name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely related to pigs. Instead,
            they originated in the Andes region of South America, where wild guinea pigs can still be found today.[2]
            Studies based on biochemistry and DNA hybridization suggest they are domesticated animals that do not exist
            naturally in the wild, but are descendants of a closely related cavy species such as C. tschudii.[3][4]
            Originally, they were domesticated as livestock (source of meat) in the Andean region and are still consumed
            in some parts of the world.[5]
            <br><br>
            In Western society, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pet since its introduction to
            Europe and North America by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, friendly
            responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them have continued to make
            guinea pigs a popular choice of household pets. Consequently, organizations devoted to the competitive
            breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide. Through artificial selection, many specialized breeds
            with varying coat colors and textures have been selected by breeders.
            <br><br>
            Livestock breeds of guinea pig play an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean peoples,
            especially as a food source.[6] They are not only used in folk medicine and in community religious
            ceremonies[7] but also raised for their meat. Guinea pigs are an important culinary staple in the Andes
            Mountains, where it is known as cuy. In the mid-2000s, marketers sought to expand its consumption beyond
            South America.[8]
            <br><br>
            Biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals
            were used so frequently as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet guinea pig came
            into use to describe a human test subject. Since that time, they have mainly been replaced by other rodents,
            such as mice and rats. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models to study such human
            medical conditions as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy (like humans, they require dietary intake of
            vitamin C), and pregnancy complications.

          <h3>The Orca</h3>
          <p>
            The orca (Orcinus orca), or killer whale, is a toothed whale and the largest member of the oceanic dolphin
            family. The only extant species in the genus Orcinus, it is recognizable by its distinct pigmentation; being
            mostly black on top, white on the bottom and having recognizable white eye patches. A cosmopolitan species,
            it inhabits a wide range of marine environments, from Arctic to Antarctic regions to tropical seas, but is
            more commonly documented in temperate or cooler coastal waters. Scientists have proposed dividing the global
            population into races, subspecies, or possibly even species.
            <br><br>
            Orcas are apex predators with a diverse diet. Individual populations often specialize in particular types of
            prey, including bony fish, sharks, rays, and marine mammals such as seals, dolphins, and whales. They are
            highly social, with some populations forming stable matrilineal family groups (pods). Their sophisticated
            hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, often unique to specific groups and passed down from generation to
            generation, are considered to be manifestations of animal culture. The most studied populations are off the
            west coast of North America, which include fish-eating "residents", mammal-eating "transients", and
            offshores.
            <br><br>
            The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the orca's conservation status as data
            deficient as multiple orca types may represent distinct species. Some local populations are threatened or
            endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), captures for marine parks, and
            conflicts with fisheries. In late 2005, the southern resident orcas were added to the U.S. Endangered
            Species list.
            <br><br>
            Orcas have been revered by indigenous peoples while Western cultures have historically feared them. They
            have been taken by whalers when stocks of larger species have declined. The orca's image took a positive
            turn in the 1960s, due to greater public and scientific awareness and their display in captivity. Since
            then, orcas have been trained to perform in marine parks, a practice that has been criticized as unethical.
            Orcas rarely pose a threat to humans, and no fatal attack has been recorded in the wild. However, captive
            orcas have injured or killed their handlers in marine theme parks.
